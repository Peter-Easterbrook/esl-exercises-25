          We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
          organisational security measures designed to protect the security of

          and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
          over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed
          to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
          cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able
          to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
          modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
          personal information, transmission of personal information to and from

      <div class="list-container">
        <p class="list-item">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
          uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
          Notice.
        </p>
        <p class="list-item">
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
          browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
          legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not
          respond to them at this time.
